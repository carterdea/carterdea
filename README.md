# Carter De Angelis



#### Scottsdale, AZ

Product-focused engineer building ecommerce and applied AI systems.

I work at the intersection of product strategy, product design, engineering, and business — helping companies ship software that moves revenue and increases efficiency.

## What I do
- Design and implement applied AI tools for ops, analytics, and workflows
- Lead product architecture from idea → production
- Ship design-forward frontends with performance and maintainability in mind
- Build Shopify apps and custom ecommerce platforms

## How I work
- Outcome-driven, not framework-driven
- Strong opinions, loosely held
- Bias toward simple systems that scale
- Prefer boring tech where it makes sense

## Tech I use
- **Backend:** Node.js, Typescript, Python, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, GraphQL
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion
- **Ecommerce:** Shopify (Custom Themes, Apps, Headless)
- **AI:** LLM tooling, RAG pipelines (LangChain/LangGraph), Workflow automation (Custom & N8N), Prompt Engineering, Context Engineering

> Note: Most of my production work is in private repos for obvious reasons.

## Currently
- Building applied AI tooling for ecommerce and operations
- Exploring agent-based workflows and system orchestration
